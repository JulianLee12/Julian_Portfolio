One of my favorite subjects is math because I enjoy solving problems and exploring new concepts. I also love coding, which allows me to create my own programs and understand how computers work‚Äîit‚Äôs like solving puzzles in a different way! Besides academics, I am a big fan of sports. I enjoy playing basketball because I like teamwork and trying to improve my skills on the court. Golf is another sport I enjoy, as it helps me stay focused and disciplined while having a relaxing time outdoors. In my free time, I like to challenge myself with new projects, whether it‚Äôs a coding project or practicing my basketball shots. I believe that trying new things and staying curious helps me grow and have fun every day. I‚Äôm excited to keep learning, playing, and exploring new interests in the future!")
